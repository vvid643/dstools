# Motivation
Data science work requires a lot of effort in scrubbing, sanitising, slicing, sampling and scanning the data using all sorts of tools and devices. While a great deal of libraries and frameworks are available to help with these tasks, I have felt a need for a package that would bootstrap these tools in a more ready state for a data analyst/engineer/scientist, so that they can get to a desired result more quickly.
# Utilities
- Development utilities
- Utility for type checking in python
